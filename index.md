# Willmund-lab


Our research group focusses on understanding protein biogenesis in the chloroplast of green alga and land plants. Chloroplast protein biogenesis is an important regulator step that helps plants to adjust their photosynthesis machinery and other important biochemical processes to changing environmental conditions. Understanding these processes in particularly important in the context of global warming, with increased extreme weather events, that challenge photosynthesis, and has direct impact on plant production and thus our food supply. We couple these basic research themes with innovative synthetic biology approaches, in order to implement our findings and engineer novel chloroplast pathways.

The main focus of our lab is about understanding the complex formation of the photosynthetic machinery in the chloroplast, stress resiliance in photosynthetic organisms, identifying protein synthesis regulators during acclimation and how to harness the chloroplast gene-expression apparatus for synthetic biology.
