As a project manager, I take care of everything, researchers do not have the time, energy or motivation to: organizing retreats, conferences, meetings; keeping homepages up to date and keep social media running; writing reports; keeping track of finances; etc etc
I am a biologist by training, so I understand more or less what the research is about, but instead of standing in the lab and taking care of chloroplasts, I spend most of my time in front of my computer!
