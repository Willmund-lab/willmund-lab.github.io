Michael is a PhD researcher working on chloroplast engineering in the green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*. His research combines synthetic biology with plant and algal systems, driven by a broader interest in engineering photosynthetic organisms to explore their potential. He completed his Masterâ€™s thesis in Brunswick in the lab of Boas Pucker. Outside the lab, he enjoys jogging and listening to British post-punk.
