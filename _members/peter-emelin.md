Peter is a PhD researcher who is interested in co-translational acetylation and its effects on various proteins in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using methods such as CRISPR/Cas and Mass Spectrometry. He also researches the functions of a protein called PSRP1, whose homologs lead to ribosome hibernation in cyanobacteria and whether a similar effect could be observed in C. reinhardtii.
In his free time he is doing lots of photography, tinkering with everything mechanical, playing guitar and riding his motorcycle.
