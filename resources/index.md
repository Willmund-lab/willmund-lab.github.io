This page provides quick access to our main online resources.

## Software and Code Repositories

- [**Lab Code Repository**](https://github.com/orgs/Willmund-lab/repositories)  
  Our central GitHub organization hosting all software, pipelines, and analysis tools developed in the lab.

## DNA Assembly Resources

- [**Chloroplast MoClo Collection**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-025-02126-2)  
  The **Chloro**plast **Mod**ular **A**ssembly **S**ystem (**CHLOROMODAS**) provides a versatile toolkit for engineering the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome. It uses a hierarchical Golden Gate-based cloning strategy to assemble standardized genetic parts — promoters, UTRs, coding sequences, terminators, and specialized connectors — into single transcription units (Level 1) or multigene constructs (Level 2). The system incorporates chloroplast-specific homology regions for precise site-directed integration, enabling flexible and efficient genome editing.
